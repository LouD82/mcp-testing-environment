# MCP Testing Protocol

This document outlines the recommended protocol for testing MCP servers using the MCP Testing Environment. It emphasizes a human-first, functional testing approach that prioritizes the user experience over code inspection.

## Testing Principles

1. **Human-First**: Always start testing from the perspective of a human user
2. **Functional Over Technical**: Focus on functionality before diving into technical details
3. **End-to-End**: Test complete user workflows rather than isolated components
4. **Iterative**: Follow a cycle of test, diagnose, fix, and verify

## Testing Workflow

### Phase 1: Functional Testing

1. **Start the MCP Testing Environment**
   ```bash
   python mcp_testing_environment.py
   ```

2. **Configure the MCP Server**
   - Set up the server configuration in the web interface
   - Start all necessary components

3. **Simulate Human Interaction**
   - Use the MCP Client Simulator to send natural language queries
   - Example queries:
     - "Has anything been said about [topic] recently?"
     - "Can you summarize the discussion in [channel] from yesterday?"
     - "What are the most active channels this week?"
   - Focus on queries that a real user would ask

4. **Observe and Document Behavior**
   - Record the server's responses
   - Note any unexpected behavior, delays, or errors
   - Capture the user experience: Is it intuitive? Responsive? Accurate?

5. **Identify User-Facing Issues**
   - Categorize issues by impact on user experience
   - Prioritize issues that directly affect functionality

### Phase 2: Technical Diagnosis

Only after completing Phase 1 should you proceed to technical diagnosis:

1. **Check Logs**
   - Use the Log Aggregation System to view logs from all components
   - Look for error messages related to the identified issues

2. **Inspect Network Traffic**
   - Use the Web UI Testing Component to inspect API calls
   - Verify data flow between components

3. **Review Container Status**
   - Use the Docker Container Management Interface to check container health
   - Verify resource usage and connectivity

4. **Examine Code**
   - Only after the above steps, review code to identify root causes
   - Focus on areas directly related to the identified issues

### Phase 3: Implementation and Verification

1. **Implement Fixes**
   - Make targeted changes to address the identified issues
   - Focus on minimal, specific changes rather than broad refactoring

2. **Verify with Functional Testing**
   - Return to Phase 1 to test the fixes
   - Verify that the user experience has improved
   - Ensure no new issues have been introduced

3. **Document Changes**
   - Record what was changed and why
   - Update documentation if necessary

## Testing Scenarios

### Discord MCP Server Testing

When testing a Discord MCP server, follow this specific workflow:

1. **Start with User Queries**
   - "Has anything been said about [topic] in the Discord server?"
   - "What were the main discussions in [channel] yesterday?"
   - "Who are the most active users in the server?"
   - "Can you summarize the conversation about [topic]?"

2. **Test Channel Data Export/Import**
   - Request data from specific channels
   - Verify data accuracy and completeness

3. **Test Message Retrieval**
   - Ask for specific messages or conversations
   - Verify correct threading and context

4. **Test Search Functionality**
   - Search for keywords across channels
   - Verify relevance and accuracy of results

5. **Test User Interaction**
   - Simulate user commands and interactions
   - Verify appropriate responses

### Web UI Testing

When testing the web UI component of an MCP server:

1. **Start with User Navigation**
   - Navigate through the UI as a user would
   - Test common user flows and interactions

2. **Test Visualization Features**
   - Verify data visualizations are accurate
   - Test interactive elements

3. **Test Responsiveness**
   - Verify UI responsiveness on different screen sizes
   - Test loading states and transitions

## Common Issues and Diagnosis

| User-Facing Issue | Possible Technical Causes | Diagnosis Steps |
|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Slow responses | Network latency, inefficient queries, resource constraints | Check response times, review query patterns, monitor resource usage |
| Incorrect data | Data synchronization issues, parsing errors | Verify data sources, check parsing logic, review transformation steps |
| Missing information | Incomplete data fetching, permission issues | Check API responses, verify permissions, review data completeness |
| Error messages | Exception handling, validation failures | Review error logs, check input validation, test edge cases |

## Best Practices

1. **Document Everything**
   - Record all test scenarios and results
   - Document issues and their resolutions

2. **Test Incrementally**
   - Start with simple queries before complex ones
   - Add complexity gradually to isolate issues

3. **Compare with Expected Behavior**
   - Have a clear understanding of expected behavior
   - Compare actual results against expectations

4. **Focus on User Impact**
   - Always relate technical issues back to user impact
   - Prioritize fixes based on user experience

5. **Test in Realistic Conditions**
   - Use realistic data volumes and query patterns
   - Simulate typical usage scenarios

## Conclusion

By following this testing protocol, you'll ensure that MCP servers are tested from a human-first perspective, focusing on the actual user experience rather than starting with code inspection. This approach leads to more effective testing and better outcomes for users.
