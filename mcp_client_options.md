# MCP Client Options Research

## Official SDKs

### Python SDK
- **Repository**: [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
- **Features**:
  - Build MCP clients that can connect to any MCP server
  - Create MCP servers that expose resources, prompts and tools
  - Use standard transports like stdio and SSE
  - Handle all MCP protocol messages and lifecycle events
- **Installation**: `pip install "mcp[cli]"` or `uv add "mcp[cli]"`
- **Development Tools**: Includes CLI tools for testing and debugging
- **Testing Capabilities**: Supports development mode with `mcp dev server.py`

### TypeScript SDK
- **Repository**: [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)
- **Features**:
  - Build MCP clients that can connect to any MCP server
  - Create MCP servers that expose resources, prompts and tools
  - Use standard transports like stdio and SSE
  - Handle all MCP protocol messages and lifecycle events
- **Installation**: `npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
- **Testing Capabilities**: Includes testing and debugging utilities

## Available MCP Clients

| Client | Resources | Prompts | Tools | Sampling | Notes |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| Claude Desktop App | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Full support for all MCP features |
| Claude Code | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Supports prompts and tools |
| Continue | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Full support for all MCP features |
| fast-agent | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full multimodal MCP support, with end-to-end tests |
| Cline | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | Supports tools and resources |
| Copilot-MCP | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | Supports tools and resources |
| mcp-agent | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Supports tools, server connection management, and agent workflows |

## Testing-Relevant Clients

1. **fast-agent**:
   - Provides end-to-end tests for MCP
   - Includes passthrough and playback simulators
   - Supports interactive front-end for developing and diagnosing Agent applications

2. **mcp-agent**:
   - Supports server connection management
   - Enables agent workflows
   - Partial support for sampling

3. **Claude Desktop App**:
   - Comprehensive support for MCP features
   - Local server connections for enhanced privacy and security

## Implications for Testing Environment

Based on this research, a comprehensive MCP testing environment could leverage:

1. **Official SDKs**:
   - Python SDK for server and client implementation
   - TypeScript SDK for web-based components

2. **Testing Tools**:
   - `mcp dev` command from Python SDK for local testing
   - fast-agent's simulators for automated testing

3. **Client Simulation**:
   - Implement a client simulator based on the Python or TypeScript SDK
   - Support for all MCP features (resources, prompts, tools, sampling)

4. **Integration Options**:
   - Potential integration with existing clients like Claude Desktop App or fast-agent
   - Custom implementation for specific testing needs

This information will guide our research into testing frameworks specifically for MCP in the next step.
