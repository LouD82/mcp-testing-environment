# MCP Testing Frameworks Research

## MCP Inspector

The MCP Inspector is an interactive developer tool specifically designed for testing and debugging MCP servers.

### Features
- **Server Connection Management**: Allows selecting the transport for connecting to the server
- **Resource Testing**: Lists available resources, shows metadata, allows content inspection
- **Prompt Testing**: Displays available prompt templates, enables testing with custom arguments
- **Tool Testing**: Lists available tools, enables testing with custom inputs
- **Notification Monitoring**: Presents logs and notifications from the server

### Usage
- Runs directly through `npx` without requiring installation:
  ```
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector <command>
  ```
- Can be used to inspect servers from NPM, PyPi, or locally developed servers

### Development Workflow
1. **Start Development**
   - Launch Inspector with your server
   - Verify basic connectivity
   - Check capability negotiation
2. **Iterative Testing**
   - Make server changes
   - Rebuild the server
   - Reconnect the Inspector
   - Test affected features
   - Monitor messages
3. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Invalid inputs
   - Missing prompt arguments
   - Concurrent operations
   - Verify error handling

## Claude Desktop Developer Tools

Claude Desktop provides tools for testing and debugging MCP servers:

### Features
- **Integration Testing**: Test MCP servers in a real client environment
- **Log Collection**: View detailed MCP logs from Claude Desktop
- **Chrome DevTools Integration**: Access Chrome's developer tools for client-side debugging

### Capabilities
- **Server Status Checking**: View connected servers, available prompts, resources, and tools
- **Log Viewing**: Review detailed MCP logs including connection events, configuration issues, runtime errors, and message exchanges
- **Network Inspection**: Inspect message payloads and connection timing

## fast-agent Framework

fast-agent is a Python framework for building, testing, and deploying MCP-enabled agents and workflows.

### Features
- **Complete MCP Support**: First framework with complete, end-to-end tested MCP feature support including Sampling
- **Multi-modal Support**: Supports Images and PDFs for both Anthropic and OpenAI endpoints
- **Model Compatibility**: Works with Anthropic (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) and OpenAI models (gpt-4o family, o1/o3 family)
- **Testing Capabilities**: Includes passthrough and playback LLMs for rapid development and testing
- **Declarative Syntax**: Simple syntax for composing Prompts and MCP Servers

### Testing Capabilities
- **Passthrough and Playback Simulators**: Enable rapid development and testing of Python glue-code
- **Interactive Development**: Chat with individual Agents and Components before, during, and after workflow execution
- **Simple Model Selection**: Makes testing Model <-> MCP Server interaction painless
- **Workflow Testing**: Test complex agent workflows with multiple components

## Other Testing Tools and Approaches

### Server Logging
- **Custom Logging Implementations**: Implement logging for server-side events
- **Error Tracking**: Track and log error conditions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor and log operation timing and resource usage

### Debugging Best Practices
- **Structured Logging**: Use consistent formats, include context, add timestamps, track request IDs
- **Error Handling**: Log stack traces, include error context, track error patterns, monitor recovery
- **Performance Tracking**: Log operation timing, monitor resource usage, track message sizes, measure latency

## Implications for MCP Testing Environment

Based on this research, a comprehensive MCP testing environment could leverage:

1. **MCP Inspector**: For interactive testing and debugging of MCP servers
2. **fast-agent Framework**: For end-to-end testing of MCP features and agent workflows
3. **Claude Desktop**: For integration testing in a real client environment
4. **Custom Logging System**: For aggregating logs from multiple sources (MCP server, Docker containers, web UI)
5. **Automated Testing Scripts**: Using fast-agent's capabilities for automated testing

This combination of tools would provide a robust environment for testing MCP servers, with capabilities for both interactive debugging and automated testing.
